**Reduce Recurring Obsolete Alerts:**

**Alert Correlation & Deduplication: **
Look for features in your ticketing system or integrate tools that can correlate similar alerts and group them together. This reduces the noise and allows agents to focus on unique issues.

**Alert Root Cause Analysis:** 

Tools with AI/ML capabilities can analyze historical data to identify root causes of recurring alerts. This helps in tackling the problem at its source, preventing constant tickets. Some ticketing systems offer these features, or you can explore dedicated tools like Moogly or OpsGenie.

**Alert Automation & Self-Healing:**
Implement automated actions based on specific alerts. For example, restarting a service or rerouting traffic upon receiving a server overload alert. Integrations with configuration management tools like Ansible or Chef can achieve this.


**Improve Prioritization:**

**Automated Prioritization Rules:** 
Set up rules within the ticketing system to automatically prioritize tickets based on factors like urgency, impact, or keywords in the description. This reduces manual effort in sorting through tickets.

**SLA Management: **
Implement Service Level Agreements (SLAs) within your ticketing system. This defines response and resolution times for different ticket severities, ensuring critical issues are addressed first. Most ticketing systems offer SLA features.

**Integration with Monitoring Tools:**
Integrate your ticketing system with monitoring tools that track application performance and infrastructure health. This allows creating tickets automatically when issues arise, with pre-populated information about the problem, improving prioritization.
